Mini challenge #2 "Add 2 Numbers"
The console will prompt the user to enter two numbers so we can add them and then display the sum in the console

Reviewer: Ulises Ortega

Review Comments: the programa does ask fo the numbers and add them together if both are numbers, if I enter and A it kicks me out but it does give a option to return to the rphtam or asking for data a valid entry, I can see that you approach the if statement diferently with a break and the write message, the play again feauture works but it's not limited to end as a single option, I typed maybe and it ran again, minor details to be work on.
